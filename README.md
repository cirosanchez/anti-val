# ANTI-VAL
I found myself in an addiction to valorant. I made this extension after uninstalling this horrible game to avoid myself of downloading valorant again.

1. Open playvalorant.com
2. Close
3. Open random video from youtube that talks about gaming addiction
4. Great Success.

Please, game addiction is NOT a joke. Is a serious topic. I've been addict to various games and, not only my academic performance but my social life were affected. Please, moderate gaming sessions.
